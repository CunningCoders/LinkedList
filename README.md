# LinkedList
Platform for dev-to-dev collaboration.

LinkedList provides web developers with the collaboration tools they need to ship code. Project owners can create a new LinkedList project, and specify which aspects, frameworks, or tools they wish for collaborators to work on. Other users can then express interest in a project position as long as the project owner desires. Then the owner simply looks over the profiles and on-site reputations of the developers who have signed up, and picks the best match for each collaborator position on the project. Upon project completion, both the project owner and the collaborators have the opportunity to rate and review each other, allowing good collaborators to build up their community reputation and protecting project owners from collaborators who are unpleasant to work with. 

## Getting Started
Getting started on LinkedList is easy! Simply signup with your Github account through our secure OAuth system, fill in a couple of basic details about your skills and preferred frameworks, and you are ready to get collaborating! We make it simple so you can spend your time shipping code.
